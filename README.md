## Abstract
Nations around the world with different cultures and traditions have economic and political relationships with each 
other. Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan American fact tank that does not take policy positions, provides information 
about how the world feels about the United States. However, the number of countries is limited to thirty-seven. Our 
proposed project investigates only the quotations over five years to learn how other nations see a specific country. 
The dataset contains quotes from sources who are perceived to be biased in many issue areas. Thus, we identify factors 
that create those biases and eliminate them from our dataset to achieve comparable outcomes to the Pew Research Center 
for those thirty-seven countries. Consequently, we will estimate the favorability of the rest of the world towards the 
United States.
